# time-series-classification

This repository contains a simple comparison between distance based methods for time series classification. 

In particular, the algorithms compared are:
- 1-NN using Euclidean Distance
- 1-NN using DTW Distance
- Shapelet Model, considering 5 shapelets of length 5 (and Stochastic Gradient Descent)
- Shapelet Model, considering 5 shapelets of length 10 (and Stochastic Gradient Descent)
- Support Vector Machine using Global Alignment Kernel

The Notebook was created to compare methods discussed in the Presentation on "TIme Series Classification" for the course "AIM-3 Scalable Data Science at TU Berlin.
